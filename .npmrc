# Ensures pnpm creates a lockfile that is optimized for workspace filtering

# --- Strictness & Reliability ---
# Fails the build if the lockfile is out of sync (perfect for CI)

# Prevents "phantom dependencies" (importing packages not in your package.json)
# This is pnpm's superpower; don't disable it unless absolutely necessary.

# Automatically installs peer dependencies to avoid manual 'missing peer' errors

# Ensures peer dependencies are grouped correctly (prevents multiple React versions)

# --- Hoisting (The "Escape Hatch") ---
# If specific tools (like React Native or old Webpack versions) break because 
# they can't find nested dependencies, uncomment the line below. 
# BUT: Try to fix them via 'pnpm.packageExtensions' in package.json first.
